/**
 * Keyless decoder for eufy `v2_eufysecurity:` event / thumbnail images.
 *
 * The v2 wire format is NOT end-to-end encrypted and needs NO key, cipher, or
 * E2E private key. It is *head-only obfuscation*: only a fixed ~286-byte JPEG
 * prefix is AES-GCM encrypted (SOI + APP0/JFIF + the two DQT quantization
 * tables + SOF dimensions + the first DHT table). Everything from the standard
 * baseline DC-chrominance Huffman table marker (`FF C4 00 1F 01`) onward — the
 * rest of the DHT, the SOS, the entire entropy-coded scan and the EOI — is left
 * as plaintext, standard baseline JPEG.
 *
 * So we reconstruct a viewable JPEG by splicing a freshly built *standard*
 * libjpeg header (correct width/height + chroma subsampling) onto the blob's
 * plaintext tail. The encrypted prefix only ever held the quantization tables
 * (=> a small quality/colour shift if we substitute standard q85 tables) and
 * the image dimensions (=> the only thing that must be pinned exactly).
 *
 * Wire format:  v2_eufysecurity:<SERIAL>:<10-digit-pkt>:<binary-ciphertext>
 *
 * Reverse-engineered 2026-06-04. Verified on 136 live blobs across every camera
 * model / resolution under HomeBase 3 (dominant 256x144 4:2:0 = event thumbnail).
